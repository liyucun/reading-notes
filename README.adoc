## GraphQL

*Core Principles*: think graph, not endpoints; single source of truth; thin api layer

*Authorization Implementation*:

*Cache*: Globally Unique Cache Key; Refetch Identifier; Opaque to Clients

## React

`props` flow down the component tree, `state` is managed by a component alone and `functions` can bubble up to alter the state in a component that manages state. The updated state can be passed down as props again.

In your top level component(React root component), you would declare the state container in the `React context`(https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-provider-pattern-context/[How to use React's Provider Pattern]) so that it is implicitly accessible for each component down the component tree.

## Python

* Most of the groundwork for coroutines occurred in the 60s/70s and then stopped in favor of alternatives (e.g., threads, continuations).

* *Generators vs. Coroutines*: Generators pull data through the pipe with iteration, Coroutines push data into the pipeline with send().

* Coroutines are somewhat similar to OO design patterns involving simple `handler` objects. Coroutines can be used to write various components that process event streams.

* One send data to coroutines directly, or one send data to threads via `queues`, or one send data to processes via `messages`. You can package coroutines inside threads or subprocesses by adding extra layers.

* With coroutines, you can separate the implementation of a task from its execution environment. The coroutine is the implementation, and the environment is whatever you choose (threads, subprocesses, network, etc.).

* Coroutines are `tasks`, but they're not tied to threads or subprocesses.

## System Design

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpspO9K28PM&list=WL&index=17[Four Distributed Systems Architectural Patterns by Tim Berglund]

* Modern Three-Tier(Presentation Tier, Business Tier, Data Tier)

Weakness: state in the middle tier

image::assets/modern_three_tier.png[]

* Sharded

Strengths: Client isolation is easy(data and deployment); Known, simple technologies

Weaknesses: complexity; no comprehensive view of data(ETL); oversized shards

image::assets/sharded_architecture.png[]

* Lambda Architecture

Strengths: optimizes subsystems based on operational requirements; good at unbounded data

Weaknesses: complex to operate and maintain; no, seriously(need write same code twice)

* Streaming

https://www.confluent.io/blog/publishing-apache-kafka-new-york-times/[Publishing with Apache Kafka at The New York Times]

* API-based architecture issues: inconsistent schema; difficult to stream content archives

* Log-based architecture:
** databases is difficult to manage in the long run: tricky to change the schema; hard to replace; being complex monoliths.
** Log-based architecture makes the log the source of truth.
** Every system can create its own data store (database) – its own materialized view – representing only the data it needs, in the form that is the most useful for that system.
** Simplifies accessing streams of content.
** By always redeploying a new instance from scratch instead of modifying a running one, a whole category of problems go away.

* why Kafka not Amazon SQS/SNS and Google Pubsub: only Kafka supports retain all events forever and log consumption to be ordered.

* The Monolog is new source of truth for published content. Every system that creates content, when it’s ready to be published, will write it to the Monolog, where it is appended to the end.
* In the denormalized log, all the components making up a top-level asset are published together.
* Since this log is denormalized, it no longer needs total ordering.

https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html[Serverless Architectures]

* Serverless architectures refer to applications that significantly depend on third-party services (knows as Backend as a Service or "BaaS") or on custom code that's run in ephemeral containers (Function as a Service or "FaaS").

* FaaS's scale is completely transparent.

* Compare with PaaS
** need to think about scale
** better tooling, maturity of API gateways, support in-app readonly cache for optimization.

* Compare with Container
** need to provide auto-scale functionality
** FaaS is seen as a better choice for event driven style with few event types per application component, and containers are seen as a better choice for synchronous-request driven components with many entry points.

* Stored Procedures as a Service: FaaS functions are small pieces of code that wrap access to a database.

* Benefits
** Reduced operational cost
*** Serverless Backend as a Service on the other hand is a result of entire application components being commoditized.
*** only pay for the compute that you need(occasional requests, inconsistent traffic, optimization is the root of some cost savings)
** Easier Operational Management
*** no longer need to even think about the question of how many concurrent requests you can handle before running out of memory or seeing too much of a performance hit
*** zero system administration
*** short time to market

* Drawbacks
** Inherent Drawbacks: vendor control, multitenancy problems, vendor lock-in, security concerns, repetition of logic across client platforms, loss of Server optimizations, no in-server state for Serverless FaaS
** Implementation Drawbacks: no configuration, limits concurrent executions(AWS Lambda), execution duration(5 minutes), startup latency, hard to integration testing, deployment/packaging/versioning, over-ambitious API Gateways

https://www.infoq.com/articles/AmazonPubSub[Implementing Pub/Sub based on AWS technologies]

* Simple Notification Service: a web service that enables applications, end-users, and devices to instantly send and receive notifications from the cloud.

* Simple Queuing Service: offers reliable and scalable hosted queues for storing messages as they travel between computers.
** By using Amazon SQS, you can move data between distributed components of your applications that perform different tasks without losing messages or requiring each component to be always available.

* Combining SQS with SNS offers two additional advantages not provided by SNS alone – removing temporal coupling and supporting symmetric load balancing of specific consuming applications.

* The main drawback of this implementation is that both publishers and subscribers need to explicitly agree on the names of SNS topics. Additionally, if a given consumer wants to get information from multiple topics, he needs to register his queue to the multiple topics.

* Solution: tree-based topic organization, content-based message filtering

https://herbertograca.com/2017/10/05/event-driven-architecture/[Event-Driven Architecture]

* Decouple components
** The dispatcher should be a library completely independent of our application and therefore installed in a generic location using a dependency management system.
** The event is shared between the components and it is part of the core of the application. Events are part of what DDD calls the Shared Kernel.

* Perform async tasks

* Keep track of state changes(audit log)
** Event Notification: need some logic in other components; event carries minimal data
** Event-Carried State Transfer: need data from other components; event carry the whole new version of the data
** Event-Sourcing: event store becomes the principal source of truth; Reversal Transaction; use snapshot to help deriving state; projection(the computation of the events in an event stream from and to specific moments)
*** Drawback - External updates(events trigger updates in external systems)
*** Drawback - External Queries(query to an external system)
*** Drawback - Code Changes(use strategy pattern)
