## GraphQL

*Core Principles*: think graph, not endpoints; single source of truth; thin api layer

*Authorization Implementation*:

*Cache*: Globally Unique Cache Key; Refetch Identifier; Opaque to Clients

## React

`props` flow down the component tree, `state` is managed by a component alone and `functions` can bubble up to alter the state in a component that manages state. The updated state can be passed down as props again.

In your top level component(React root component), you would declare the state container in the `React context`(https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-provider-pattern-context/[How to use React's Provider Pattern]) so that it is implicitly accessible for each component down the component tree.

## Python

* Most of the groundwork for coroutines occurred in the 60s/70s and then stopped in favor of alternatives (e.g., threads, continuations).

* *Generators vs. Coroutines*: Generators pull data through the pipe with iteration, Coroutines push data into the pipeline with send().

* Coroutines are somewhat similar to OO design patterns involving simple `handler` objects. Coroutines can be used to write various components that process event streams.

* One send data to coroutines directly, or one send data to threads via `queues`, or one send data to processes via `messages`. You can package coroutines inside threads or subprocesses by adding extra layers.

* With coroutines, you can separate the implementation of a task from its execution environment. The coroutine is the implementation, and the environment is whatever you choose (threads, subprocesses, network, etc.).

* Coroutines are `tasks`, but they're not tied to threads or subprocesses.

## Distributed System

* Modern Three-Tier(Presentation Tier, Business Tier, Data Tier)
Weakness: state in the middle tier

* Sharded

Strengths: Client isolation is easy(data and deployment); Known, simple technologies

Weaknesses: complexity; no comprehensive view of data(ETL); oversized shards

* Lambda Architecture

Strengths: optimizes subsystems based on operational requirements; good at unbounded data

Weaknesses: complex to operate and maintain; no, seriously(need write same code twice)

* Streaming
